[CourseFlo](https://course-flo.herokuapp.com) is designed to help students see the course relationships in an easy to use, compact manner. With this tool, students can explore courses across all departments without the need for back-and-forths and time wasted going down a rabbit hole of related courses.

## Tech overview:
*   Unit 1:
    *   Rough prototypes were made for our app, which formed the basis of our development. HTML elements are mostly represented through JSX, which were blended in with Material-UI components. CSS (styling) is applied using the Material-UI module useStyles(). Finally, JavaScript established how the logic of our application will function and we could set the groundwork for when we move forward with React and Redux.
*   Unit 2:
    *   React and Redux were used to create the frontend of our app. Using React, we could create components to represent the various objects and elements as well as define functions and variables within each componenets to dictate their logic. Examples of components we created include the modal windows, the navbar, and the search course form. Redux allows centralizing of the data within our app inside a store, which can be managed through actions and reducers. Components can access this store to take data it needs to function. Prevalent applications of the Redux store include authentication, course visualization, and modal management.
*   Unit 3:
    *   We used MongoDB as our database, in which we defined one collection for courses and one for users. The information stored here is used as long term data storage, when data is not already stored in the backend or frontend.
*   Unit 4:
    *   Our backend (API) is constructed using ExpressJS, which we can use to define routes and models to serve the frontend the information it needs. In conjunction with REST, we could make frontend actions meaningful within the scope of the application. This is done by linking actions to their corresponding routes so that they may interact with the database properly. Model schema definitions were created using Mongoose while API calls and subsequent data management in the frontend were performed using Axios with Redux Thunk.
*   Unit 5:
    *   Our project is deployed on Heroku. We have continuous deployment set up with our Github repository, automatically deploying changes to our main branches to Heroku. It also goes through isolated beta and production stages, as well as having a separate dev environment.

## Description of "Above and Beyond" Functionality
*   Our visualizer was developed with the capability to dive deeper than just a layer of related courses, allowing for a high level view of all related courses for a selected course. And it does so while remaining nimble in course switching and rendering.
*   Our app was built to be fully responsive, usable on mobile, tablet and laptop screens. Introducing media queries based on dimensions of screen, and utilizing Material-UI's built-in responsive components helped achieve this.
*   We built a caching system for our high-traffic, high-quantity data (courses) to allow for a faster experience, in particular while navigating the visualizer.
*   Custom authentication system is built from scratch using JWT tokens and we store session information in a browser's storage so that the login status can persist
*   The search feature made use of the filtering UI and NoSQL query building in our backend, to quickly query the courses searched for in the DB.
*   We decided to push to use TypeScript and the Airbnb style (w/ ESLint), to force a rapidly evolving 4 person project to adhere to consistent coding standards.

## Discussion of Next Steps
*   Future implementations we have in mind include 3d visualization in a network-like fashion. This includes the ability to zoom in on a course and look at the direct dependents of the course at each layer. One would also be able to move up the network of pre-requisite courses in a visually pleasing manner to navigate through the progression of a course.
*   Another future implementation includes a course recommendation system. Given a students starred courses they have taken, recommend them courses based on similar (pre-requisite, degree requirements, similar concepts) courses offered. An addition to this implementation includes recommending based on most starred courses, and other parameters like the requirements left to a userâ€™s degree.
*   Being able to visualize course data from other schools is another feature we'd like to add. We would need to format the data appropriately, and only then can a similar visualization can take place. Challenges we can see when implementing include having to handle multiple types of identifiers for courses, or having to parse multiple times for correct information.

## Contributing:
We love feedback and improvements! If you feel like making some changes, just:
- Clone CourseFlo/Flo repo on your local environment: `git clone https://github.com/CourseFlo/Flo.git` in your local terminal.
